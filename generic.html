            I finished my high-school in Yangon, Myanmar.
			It is the commercial city in Myanmar, where most of the economy runs and the major tourist destination.
			Although the country did not have enough technology to teach students especially
			information technology and programming courses, I researched about programming
			and technology on my own. Due to the lack of technological resources, I decided
			to continue my further education in the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back in Fall of 2018, I went to attend University of Illinois at Chicago. At that time,
			I was doubting if I could major in Computer Science since I heard that it is one of the
			most challenging majors. Therefore, I decided to go with an undeclared major for a year.
			As time went by, after facing strong culture shocks and unfamilar weather conditions,
			I decided to transfer to Orange Coast College in Orange County, California in Fall 2019.
      By then, I declared my major as Computer Science to pursue my dream to work in the technology 
      field. Although I faced several challenges, I managed to get an Associates of Science
			degree from Orange Coast College, and transferred to California State University - Fullerton.
			My dream is to help people use technology easier, faster, and more efficient.
